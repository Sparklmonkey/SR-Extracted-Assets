In the world of Arachna, you will find different enemies and mini-games. Upon completing a mini-game or defeating an enemy, you will receive Gils. You can then visit merchants and buy cards with your Gils.This may improve your deck and make you stronger in combat. But beware! The more powerful a card is, the more expensive it is.You will find merchants in the city, in the village and in the school.
